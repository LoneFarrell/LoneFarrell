Ordered Sections (OS) for clarity and recursion tracking.

0. Summary
	•	⚙️ Symbolic-computational systems architect merging accounting precision, recursive automation, and emotive intelligence into executable research frameworks.
	•	🌍 Building the SporeNet OS — a symbolic-emotive operating system unifying law, language, computation, and economy through recursive design.

1. Profile Snapshot
	•	👋 Hi, I’m Christopher Ryan Farrell (@LoneFarrell)
	•	🧭 Translating enterprise accounting, symbolic logic, and computational forensics into scalable automation and research architectures.

2. Core Interests
	•	🔗 symbolic operating systems and identity authentication protocols
	•	💠 recursive computation, cultivation algebra, and AI-governed law
	•	🪙 tokenized certification economies and compliance automation
	•	🌱 emotional-symbolic cognition, privacy, and sustainable data ethics

3. Current Learning & Research
	•	🌿 refining SporeLang and SporeVM — symbolic-emotive programming & runtime layers
	•	🌿 advancing SYMQ-1 metrics for growth, recursion, and wellbeing tracking
	•	🌿 integrating Cultivation Algebra into adaptive economic & decision frameworks
	•	🌿 developing safe, open SDKs for symbolic certification (SporeCert / CaaS)

4. Collaboration Goals
	•	🤝 expand symbolic-economic infrastructure (SEPS / SEIF / ISO-4447-S compliant)
	•	🤝 connect academic, legal, and creative partners to recursive-system research

7. Fun Fact
	•	📸 I capture nature and architectural patterns as training material for symbolic-visual AI (used in Scene Oracle and TruthReel renderers).

8. Active Projects
	•	🧬 SporeNet OS v1.1.9 (AENG) — unified symbolic-emotive operating system integrating MENDO, KRONOS, FORGE, POLYGNOME, and AENG modules.
	•	🔢 SYMQ-1 Engine — recursive scoring system measuring symbolic growth, alignment, and cognition.
	•	🌿 Cultivation Algebra Operator IDE — interactive tool for executing symbolic operators and visualizing recursion.
	•	🧾 ISO-4447-S Standard Set — international framework defining symbolic-emotive system compliance.
	•	🪞 MirrorMode / Scene Oracle / TruthReel Viewer — cinematic introspection engines for symbolic process visualization.
	•	🪪 SporeCert CaaS SDK — Certification-as-a-Service architecture bridging emotional authenticity and legal verification.

9. Build Highlights
	1.	⚡ SporeNet Public Package – canonical launch capsule combining TruthSeal, glyphmark, and Scene Oracle stream.
	2.	🧮 SDMF-1 / PIN-CogForce v1 – derivative-data and cognitive-force modeling frameworks for symbolic-analytic systems.
	3.	🌳 MENDO Plant-Brain Model – morphological cognition framework for recursive growth-path optimization.
	4.	💫 Acceptance Engine (AENG) – real-time wellbeing and choice-acknowledgment loop integrated into SporeNet runtime.

10. Toolchain & Methodology
	•	🧰 Python • TypeScript • LaTeX • OpenAI APIs • ISO/WIPO legal drafting syntax
	•	🧩 modular build pipeline linking symbolic logic, emotional metrics, and legal syntax into canonical artifacts
	•	🔒 all modules conform to SEIF (Secure Export Integrity Framework) for provenance and auditability

Repository Status

This repository serves as the narrative index for the LoneFarrell / SporeNet ecosystem, documenting symbolic-emotive research, IP filings, and SDK blueprints.
It is not a runnable codebase; treat it as a living portfolio and documentation hub for recursive-system development
