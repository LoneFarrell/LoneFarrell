# Orbital Operating Systems Logbook

![Golden OS orbits](./art/golden-os-orbits.svg)

Hi, I’m **@LoneFarrell**—mapping a practice where automation, human-centered design, and wilderness reverence co-exist across operating systems.

## Orbit Map

### Orbit 01 · Linux
- **Mission Role**: Rapid prototyping, self-hosting, and resilient civic infrastructure pilots.
- **Core Stack**: NixOS • Docker • Podman • Tailscale • WireGuard.
- **Live Tasks**:
  - Rolling out reproducible research phones for community labs and mutual-aid telemetry hubs.
  - Building GitOps pipelines that schedule data-collection bursts without eroding privacy.

### Orbit 02 · macOS
- **Mission Role**: Narrative synthesis, multimedia assembly, and speculative strategy decks.
- **Core Stack**: Logic Pro • Affinity Suite • Raycast • Runway • Stable Diffusion.
- **Live Tasks**:
  - Producing cinematic explainers that bind algebraic stories to climate-field reporting.
  - Capturing on-site photography, then threading it into AI-assisted editorial workflows.

### Orbit 03 · Windows
- **Mission Role**: Cooperative finance, transparent analytics, and partner co-creation.
- **Core Stack**: Power BI • Excel • VS Code • WSL2 • Power Automate.
- **Live Tasks**:
  - Automating compliance-friendly ledgers for small funds and grassroots treasuries.
  - Maintaining joint workspaces that merge instrumentation, policy, and creative briefs.

## Daily Telemetry

- 🌐 **Civic crypto & UBI pilots** – building accountable incentive systems focused on community care.
- 🎮 **Playable learning** – shipping small code-driven games that translate complex math into approachable stories.
- 🛰️ **Signal curation** – synthesizing AI, automation, and climate tech news into weekly field notes.

## Learning Trajectory

- Hardening container-native pipelines so research devices remain reproducible and safe in the field.
- Advancing multimodal storytelling to stitch outdoor photography, ambient sound, and AI narration.
- Designing governance patterns for ethical AI that uplift cooperative communities.

## Collaboration Signals

- Transparent fintech or accounting automation that prioritizes clarity before growth hacks.
- Experiential projects that celebrate wilderness while encouraging mindful technology use.
- Open-source experiments that invite contributors into the build loop early and often.
