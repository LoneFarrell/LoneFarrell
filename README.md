## Repository Status

This profile repository currently contains this README plus reference assets that showcase LoneFarrell’s automation, mobile research, and compliance storytelling efforts. There are no runnable build scripts in this repo, so commands like `launch` or requests for a "cultivation algebra IDE" remain out of scope. Treat this space as the narrative index for the broader LoneFarrell portfolio.
