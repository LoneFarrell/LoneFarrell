# LoneFarrell Launch Script

This repository now includes a small Python script that simulates a launch countdown.

## Usage

```bash
python launch.py
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Initiating systems check...
All systems nominal.
Engaging launch clamps.
Ignition sequence start.
Lift-off!
```
